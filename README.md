# What's The Weather Like?

Here's an app that'll work better than the weather app on your iPhone! 

This is called "What's The Weather Like?" - this app allows the user to check the weather for any given city.

It will also save the user's input in Local Storage. If the user would like to look up the same city again, they can just click on the name of that city.

Here's the live app deployment: https://github.com/tayyjohnson/whatstheweatherlike
